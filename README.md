# brave-bin package for Void Linux

This package provides Brave Browser, the browser based on Chromium with privacy in mind and a built in ad blocker. This package merely takes the .deb release version from the authors, extracts and installs the files as is. Plus, ensures the dependencies are there. **Note:** This is not building binaries from source as a proper package should. Hence the `-bin` shuffix.

The template file is prepared for use with [xbps-src](https://wiki.voidlinux.org/Xbps-src) in Void Linux.
